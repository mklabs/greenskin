## Jenkins workspace

Or job workspace (case not executing through jenkins)

Workspace should look like the following:

    - ws/
      - build.json            -> Used by downstream jobs, array of URL's build.json file
      - *.tap                 -> Used to publish results on Jenkins UI. Any number of tap files
      - results/
        - 1/
        - ...
        - 99/                 -> Build specific generated files
          - files.txt         -> A list of generated files within the dir
          - example_com/
            - build.json      -> Used to build the build.json root file
            - ...             -> Any other generated files

### Build.json

The build.json file is used accross builds and jobs to offer a generic
way to post process build results.

Typical use cases may include sending stats to a remote stats server (StatsD
/ Graphite / Cube / etc.), generating notifications and alerts, etc.

Jobs using downstreams should generate a JSON file at the root of the
workspace, following the Phantomas results structure.

```json
{
  "generator": "Generated by ..."
  "url": "http://example.com",
  "metrics": {},
  "asserts": {},
  ...
}
```
